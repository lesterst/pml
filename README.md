practical machine learning

This is a class project done for the Practical Machine Learning class on Coursera, part of the data science specialization.
It is the 8th class in the specialization
This project involves using a dataset of outputs from wearable body motion sensors to predict the quality of weight lifting exercise.
The idea is to automatically determine if the person is doing the exercise properly.
